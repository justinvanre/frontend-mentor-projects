## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- BEM method
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- swiper.js

### What I learned

Like last time, the css file got bigger and bigger, and I felt it got messy. However, that's just how it is with projects that are more complicated. As for continued development, I should dive into tools like sass to make the code more readable and easier to understand.  

### Useful resources

- [Docs swiper.js](https://swiperjs.com/get-started) - These are the docs for how to use swiper.js. It was helpful and easy to digest as I was implementing the slider.

## Acknowledgments

At first I wanted to create the slider using solely vanilla js. However, as I went through the feed of frontendmentor solutions, I came across somebody I follow that had used swiper.js. It got me interested, and it was relatively straigforward to implement as I read through the documentation.
