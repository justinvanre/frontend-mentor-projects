### What I learned

I had so fun building this project. It was challeging but straightforward, and I got to work with the dom for the first time, which was quite educational. However, I had some difficulty preventing too much of overriding code. I realized I need to pick one magnification factor and change the font size on different screensizes, allowing the component to scale down or up accordingly instead of rewriting the magnification factor every time. 


### Continued development

use the magnification factor based on the design of one screensize.
