## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- BEM method
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

With this challenge I learned how messy it can get if you build a full-page with various components. I was a little uncomfortable at first. However, I tried to focus on them seperately and iterate through the process. It was also tedious once the body font size changed, and I had to change the margins. I assume that's part of the job when trying to make it match the different designs. However, in a real life projects we can try to stick to one proportion if possible and suitable.

### Continued development

As for continued development, I want to emphasise on organizing code and dive into SASS.
